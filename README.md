# Track-the-Space-Station-in-3D
### The Challenge
Applications that track the International Space Station are easy to find online, but their features and capabilities vary. Your challenge is to build and publish an open-source web application that tracks the space station in three dimensions.

Background
Many space station trackers are available online, but they often have limited features and capabilities. For example, some are bidimensional and do not provide 3D depictions. Other trackers provide some 3D depictions but show the Station as a dot or a 2D icon instead of a 3D model. Many that do provide full 3D depictions are desktop applications and are not readily accessible via a web browser. And many trackers that are fully 3D and web-based are closed-source—there's no way to access the code to learn how they work or to improve them.

Users would benefit from an open-source web application that tracks the space station and fully depicts the Earth, the space station orbit, and the Station itself in three dimensions.

Objectives
Your challenge is to use open-source software and information available from NASA to build a feature-rich web application (i.e., an application on a website that is accessible via a web browser—not a desktop application) that tracks the space station and provides interactive, 3D visualizations of Earth, the space station orbit, and the Station itself. Think about the interesting features that someone using your app might appreciate. You can be inspired by features available in existing apps (you may use NASA materials consistent with the provided guidance, but be careful not to copy or infringe upon the creative work of others), and feel free to include your own ideas, as well. Get creative!
